## Components

### 1. File Operations Abstraction Layer (`file_system_interface.py`)

An editor-agnostic interface for file operations that provides:

- Consistent API for file operations across different platforms and environments
- Permission checking for each operation
- Error handling and logging
- Support for both binary and text operations

**Key Classes and Functions:**
- `FileSystemInterface`: Main class for file operations
- Helper functions like `read_file()`, `write_file()`, `create_directory()`, etc.

### 2. Permission Management System (`permission_manager.py`)

A robust permission tracking system that:

- Tracks user-granted permissions by path and operation type
- Supports temporary permissions with expiration
- Provides UI integration for permission requests
- Persists permissions to a JSON file
- Implements implicit workspace-based permissions

**Key Classes and Functions:**
- `PermissionManager`: Main class for tracking permissions
- `PermissionRecord`: Represents a permission granted for a specific path
- Helper functions like `check_permission()`, `grant_permission()`, etc.

### 3. Conversation History Logging (`conversation_logger.py`)

A system for storing and retrieving conversation history:

- Uses SQLite for efficient storage and querying
- Supports full-text search
- Provides export options in multiple formats
- Implements date-based filtering
- Maintains conversation structure and metadata

**Key Classes and Functions:**
- `ConversationLogger`: Main class for handling conversation storage
- `Conversation` and `ConversationEntry`: Data models for conversations
- Helper functions for adding, retrieving, and searching conversations

### 4. Advanced Windows System Manipulation (`system_operations.py`)

A comprehensive system for securely manipulating Windows system components:

- Registry management with rollback capability
- Windows service control with appropriate privileges
- Firewall rule creation and management
- Scheduled task creation and management
- Background process execution and monitoring
- Administrative privilege elevation
- Secure process execution and system command handling

**Key Classes and Functions:**
- `SystemOperationManager`: Main class for system manipulation operations
- Helper functions for registry, service, firewall, and task operations
- Background process management through thread-based execution
- Rollback mechanisms for registry operations
- UI integration for permission requests and elevation prompts

### 5. Integration Components

- **`file_operations.py`**: Integrates file system interface with permission management and adds a UI layer
- **`system_operations.py`**: Provides secure system manipulation with permission checks and privilege handling
- **`conversation_manager.py`**: High-level conversation management with context windows and summaries
- **`agentic_core.py`**: Top-level integration of all components with the AI engine

## Usage Examples

### File Operations

```python
from src.core.file_operations import FileOperationManager

# Initialize with workspace path
fm = FileOperationManager(workspace_path="/path/to/workspace")

# Read a file
content = fm.read_file("/path/to/file.txt")

# Write to a file
fm.write_file("/path/to/newfile.txt", "Hello, world!")

# Create a directory
fm.create_directory("/path/to/newdir")

# List directory contents
contents = fm.list_directory("/path/to/dir")
```

### Permission Management

```python
from src.utils.permission_manager import PermissionManager

# Initialize
pm = PermissionManager(config_path="config/permissions.json")

# Set UI callback for permission requests
pm.set_ui_callback(lambda path, op: display_dialog(path, op))

# Check permission
has_permission = pm.check_permission("/path/to/file.txt", "read")

# Grant permission (for 1 hour)
pm.grant_permission("/path/to/file.txt", ["read", "write"], duration=3600)

# Revoke permission
pm.revoke_permission("/path/to/file.txt", ["write"])
```

### Conversation History

```python
from src.core.conversation_manager import ConversationManager

# Initialize
cm = ConversationManager(db_path="logs/conversations.db")

# Start a conversation
conversation_id = cm.start_conversation("Coding Help")

# Add messages
cm.add_user_message("How do I create a Python class?")
cm.add_assistant_message("To create a Python class, use the `class` keyword...")

# Get conversation history
history = cm.get_conversation_history(conversation_id)

# Search for specific content
results = cm.search_message_content("Python class")

# Get conversations from 3 days ago
old_convs = cm.find_conversations_by_date(days_ago=3)
```

### Windows System Manipulation

```python
from src.core.system_operations import get_system_manager

# Initialize
system_manager = get_system_manager()

# Registry operations
system_manager.modify_registry(
    "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\MyApp",
    "MySetting",
    "Hello World",
    "REG_SZ"
)

# Background process execution
exit_code, stdout, stderr = system_manager.execute_command(
    "long_running_task.exe",
    background=True
)
process_id = int(stdout.split("Process ID: ")[1].strip())
status = system_manager.get_process_status(process_id)

# Service control
success, output = system_manager.manage_service("wuauserv", "query")

# Privilege elevation
if not system_manager.is_elevated:
    system_manager.elevate_privileges("Administrative operations")

# Firewall rules
system_manager.create_firewall_rule(
    "MyAppRule",
    "allow",
    "in",
    "TCP",
    8080
)

# Scheduled tasks
system_manager.create_scheduled_task(
    "DailyBackup",
    "C:\\backup.exe",
    "DAILY"
)

# Rollback registry changes
system_manager.rollback_last_operation()
```

### Complete Integration

```python
from src.core.agentic_core import AgenticCore

# Initialize with configuration
core = AgenticCore(config_path="config.json")

# Process a user request
response = core.process_user_request("Create a file named example.txt with hello world in it")

# Execute file operations
core.execute_file_operation("write_file", "example.txt", "Hello, world!")

# Execute system commands
exit_code, stdout, stderr = core.execute_command("echo Hello")

# Get conversation history
history = core.get_conversation_history(days_ago=1)
```

## Building the Windows Application

The project includes a comprehensive build system for creating Windows executables:

```python
# Build a standard windowed application
python build_windows.py

# Build with console for debugging
python build_windows.py --console

# Build a single executable file
python build_windows.py --onefile

# Create an installer
python build_windows.py --installer
```

The build script supports:
- Creating standalone executables with PyInstaller
- Packaging with necessary assets and configurations
- Creating optional installers using Inno Setup
- Command-line arguments for build customization
- Version tracking and embedding

## Testing

Unit tests for all components are provided in the `tests` directory:

- `tests/test_file_system.py`: Tests for the file system interface
- `tests/test_permission_manager.py`: Tests for the permission management system
- `tests/test_conversation_logger.py`: Tests for the conversation history logging
- `tests/test_system_operations.py`: Tests for Windows system manipulation

## Demonstration

Example applications are provided in the `examples` directory:

1. `examples/file_operations_demo.py`: Demonstrates file operations capabilities
2. `examples/windows_system_demo.py`: Demonstrates Windows system manipulation features

These examples showcase:
- Creating and manipulating files and directories
- Registry, service, firewall, and task management
- Background process execution and monitoring
- Privilege elevation
- Conversation history management

## Security Considerations

- All file operations are confined to the workspace by default
- Operations outside the workspace require explicit permissions
- Sensitive operations prompt the user for authorization
- Permissions can be time-limited
- System commands are filtered and require explicit permission
- Windows system manipulation features require explicit user approval
- Registry operations support rollback for safety
- Privilege elevation requires user consent
- All operations are logged for auditing

## Conclusion

The implemented components provide a secure, robust framework for Agentic AI to interact with the file system, manipulate Windows system components, execute system commands, and maintain conversation history. This enables the AI to be more helpful while maintaining appropriate security boundaries and user control.
